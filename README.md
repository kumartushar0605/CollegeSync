# College Connect

## Problem Statement

In the current academic landscape, students struggle to find reliable and efficient ways to solve doubts, collaborate globally, and access expert knowledge in real time. Traditional tutoring methods are often expensive, slow, or inaccessible, especially for students in remote or underserved areas. Moreover, there is no unified platform that allows students to engage with peers worldwide, limiting opportunities for collaborative learning and cultural exchange.

At the same time, many skilled students capable of tutoring or mentoring lack a centralized platform to monetize their expertise while balancing academic schedules. Additionally, competitive programming enthusiasts face challenges in tracking and preparing for contests spread across different platforms like CodeForces, LeetCode, and HackerRank. This fragmentation creates inefficiencies and hinders students from realizing their full potential in both learning and earning.

There is a clear need for an all-in-one platform that facilitates real-time doubt solving, connects students globally for collaborative learning, offers freelance tutoring opportunities, and keeps students updated on competitive contests—all in a single, accessible place.

## Proposed Solution

In today’s interconnected world, students need a dynamic platform that not only solves academic doubts in real time but also enables collaboration across borders and provides freelance opportunities. Many learners struggle with fragmented resources for competitive programming, while skilled students lack a central space to monetize their expertise. College Connect bridges these gaps by offering a unified solution that combines doubt-solving, freelance tutoring, and contest alerts in one place, ensuring seamless learning and earning opportunities for students worldwide.

### 1. Learner Section:

Student Registration: Students register by authenticating their profiles and providing essential details such as college name, batch, semester, and skill set. The platform automatically retrieves and organizes subjects based on the student’s semester, further breaking them into chapters for easier navigation.
Doubt-Solving: Learners can ask doubts for specific subjects or chapters. For broader, global queries, a separate section allows learners to post questions to a global community of learners and experts.
Contest Updates: The platform aggregates updates from major coding platforms such as CodeForces, LeetCode, and HackerRank, ensuring students never miss competitive programming contests.

### 2. Freelancer Section:

Freelancer Registration: Registered students or experts can sign up as freelancers, showcase their skills, and set their own rates for tutoring or doubt-solving services. This section allows tutors to focus on doubts relevant to their expertise.

Expert Selection: When a learner posts a doubt, the platform matches them with freelancers based on relevant skills. Learners can review profiles, ratings, and fees before confirming an expert.
Interactive Support: Freelancers answer queries through the platform and wait for student feedback. After confirmation, payment is processed seamlessly using cryptocurrency (Ether) or INR, offering flexible transactions.
Live Communication: Learners and tutors can communicate via chat and initiate video calls using a room code for deeper, personalized assistance.

### Progress Tracking:

Both learners and freelancers have access to personalized dashboards to track their doubt-solving and asking performance. Students can gauge their learning progress, while freelancers can monitor engagement and earnings.
